Your task is to evaluate the dialogue using the following criteria: Naturalness, Coherence, Engagingness, and Groundedness.

Please respond **ONLY** with the scores in the format provided below. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or comments. If the dialogue cannot be evaluated, return the scores as `0`.

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Naturalness (1-5)**: Does the system's response sound human-like, natural, and conversational in tone?
2. **Coherence (1-5)**: Does the dialogue flow logically from one turn to the next? Are the responses consistent and meaningful within the conversation?
3. **Engagingness (1-5)**: Is the dialogue engaging and interesting for the user? Does it maintain the userâ€™s attention and interest?
4. **Groundedness (1-5)**: Does the system's response provide accurate and factual information? Does it align with the context and avoid unsupported statements or hallucinations?
