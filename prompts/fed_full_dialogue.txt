You will be given a complete dialogue between a user and a system.

Your task is to evaluate the dialogue using the following criteria: Fluency, Consistency, Coherence, and Relevance.

Please respond **ONLY** with the scores in the format provided below. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or comments. If the dialogue cannot be evaluated, return the scores as `0`.

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Fluency (1-5)**: Are the system's responses grammatically correct, easy to understand, and natural in phrasing?
2. **Consistency (1-5)**: Do the system's responses provide accurate information that aligns with the dialogue context? Do they avoid contradictions or hallucinations?
3. **Coherence (1-5)**: Does the dialogue flow logically from one turn to the next? Are the responses consistent and meaningful within the conversation?
4. **Relevance (1-5)**: Do the responses stay on topic and directly address the user's inputs?

### Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read the entire dialogue to understand its tone, structure, and flow.
2. Evaluate each system response based on the defined criteria.
3. Assign a score for each criterion on a scale of 1 to 5, where:
   - `1` indicates the lowest quality,
   - `5` indicates the highest quality.
