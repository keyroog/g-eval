You will be given a complete dialogue between a user and a system.

Your task is to evaluate the dialogue using the following criteria: Coherence, Fluency, and Relevance.

Please respond **ONLY** with the scores in the format provided below. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or comments. If the dialogue cannot be evaluated, return the scores as `0`.

Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Coherence (1-5)**: Does the dialogue flow logically from one turn to the next? Are responses consistent and meaningful?
2. **Fluency (1-5)**: Are the responses grammatically correct, easy to understand, and natural in phrasing?
3. **Relevance (1-5)**: Do the responses stay on topic and directly address the user's inputs?

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read the entire dialogue to understand its tone, structure, and flow.
2. Evaluate each turn to check if responses align with the user's inputs based on the criteria.
3. Assign a score for each criterion on a scale of 1 to 5, where:
   - `1` indicates the lowest quality,
   - `5` indicates the highest quality.
