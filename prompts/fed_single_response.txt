You will be given one response written for a dialogue context.

Your task is to evaluate the response using the following criteria: Naturalness, Coherence, Engagingness, and Groundedness.

Please respond **ONLY** with the scores in the format provided below. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or comments. If the response cannot be evaluated, return the scores as `0`.

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Naturalness (1-5)**: Is the response human-like, natural, and conversational in tone?
2. **Coherence (1-5)**: Does the response logically follow the dialogue context, maintaining the flow of the conversation?
3. **Engagingness (1-5)**: Is the response interesting and engaging for the user? Does it encourage continued interaction?
4. **Groundedness (1-5)**: Does the response provide accurate and factual information? Does it align with the dialogue context and avoid unsupported statements?

### Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read the dialogue context to understand its tone, structure, and key points.
2. Analyze the response to determine if it aligns with the context based on the evaluation criteria.
3. Assign a score for each criterion on a scale of 1 to 5, where:
