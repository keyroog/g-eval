You will be given one response written for a dialogue context.

Your task is to evaluate the response using the following criteria: Coherence, Fluency, and Relevance.

Please respond **ONLY** with the scores in the format provided below. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or comments. If the response cannot be evaluated, return the scores as `0`.

Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Coherence (1-5)**: Does the response logically connect to the dialogue context? A coherent response continues the conversation meaningfully and avoids contradictions.
2. **Fluency (1-5)**: Is the response grammatically correct, easy to understand, and natural in phrasing?
3. **Relevance (1-5)**: Does the response directly address the context and stay on topic?

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read the dialogue context to understand its tone, structure, and key points.
2. Analyze the response to determine if it aligns with the context based on the evaluation criteria.
3. Assign a score for each criterion on a scale of 1 to 5, where:
   - `1` indicates the lowest quality,
   - `5` indicates the highest quality.
