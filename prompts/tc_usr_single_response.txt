You will be given a dialogue context, a system response, and a related fact.

Your task is to evaluate the response using the following criteria: Fluency, Consistency, Coherence, and Relevance. Use the provided fact to evaluate the Consistency of the response.

Please respond **ONLY** with the scores in the format provided below. Do not include any additional text, comments, or explanations. If the response cannot be evaluated, assign all scores as `0`.

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Fluency (1-5)**: Is the response grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and easy to understand?
2. **Consistency (1-5)**: Does the response provide accurate information that aligns with the dialogue context and the provided fact? Does it avoid contradictions or hallucinations?
3. **Coherence (1-5)**: Does the response logically follow the dialogue context, maintaining the flow of the conversation?
4. **Relevance (1-5)**: Does the response directly address the user's input, staying on topic and relevant?

### Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read the dialogue context to understand its tone, key points, and overall structure.
2. Review the provided fact and use it to verify the accuracy of the response.
3. Analyze the response to determine if it aligns with the dialogue context and maintains engagement based on the evaluation criteria.
4. Assign a score for each criterion (Fluency, Consistency, Coherence, Relevance) on a scale of 1 to 5, where:
   - `1` indicates the lowest quality,
   - `5` indicates the highest quality.
