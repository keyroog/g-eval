You will be given a dialogue context and a response.

Your task is to evaluate the response based on the following criteria: Coherence, Fluency, and Relevance.

Please respond **ONLY** with the scores in the format provided below. Do not include any additional text, comments, or explanations. If the response cannot be evaluated, assign all scores as `0`.

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Coherence (1-5)**: Does the response logically follow the dialogue context? A coherent response maintains the flow of the conversation and avoids contradictions.
2. **Fluency (1-5)**: Is the response grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and easy to understand?
3. **Relevance (1-5)**: Does the response stay on topic, directly addressing the context and user input?

### Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read the dialogue context to understand its tone, key points, and overall structure.
2. Analyze the response to determine if it aligns with the dialogue context based on the evaluation criteria.
3. Assign a score for each criterion (Coherence, Fluency, Relevance) on a scale of 1 to 5, where:
   - `1` indicates the lowest quality,
   - `5` indicates the highest quality.
