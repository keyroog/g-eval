I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays? Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax. Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays. Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself! I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old? Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome.. Are you doing any home decorating then? Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive. I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree. Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year. I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh? Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do. I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store? Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals. Ah that's great. My wife also likes Target a lot. She even made a Target credit card because she comes to that store very often. Okay thanks for the suggestion. I'll check out Target.",

If the conversation cannot be evaluated, assign a score of `0`.  \n\nEvaluation Criteria:  \nOverall Quality (1-3): Is the overall quality of the conversation satisfactory?  \n- Score 1 (Unsatisfactory): The conversation lacks coherence and relevance. Responses are disconnected, causing confusion or disruption in the interaction.  \n- Score 2 (Satisfactory): The conversation is generally coherent and relevant but may have minor issues. Some responses might not align perfectly with the context, or the flow may lose engagement at times. Overall, it remains understandable.  \n- Score 3 (Excellent): The conversation is fluid, natural, and well-aligned with the tone and intent of the participants. Each response is relevant, contributes to the discussion, and the conversation flows smoothly with clear and engaging interaction.  \n\nEvaluation Steps:  \n1. Read the conversation carefully.  \n2. Assign a score between 1 and 3 for overall quality based on the criteria above.  \n\nDialog:\n\nHi! What is your favorite holiday? one where I get to meet lots of different people. What was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday? Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25. Which holiday was that? I think it was Australia Do you still talk to the people you met? Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them\n\nResponse Format:  \nOverall Quality: <score>  ",

My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides. That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends. I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol. True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward. AKA avoiding all texts from everyone? Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options. People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous. Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you.

Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :) Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme. Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea? We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation.

I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s.
